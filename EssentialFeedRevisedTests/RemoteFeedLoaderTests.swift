 Lecture 2.
 Asserting a Captured Value Is Not Enough + Cross-Module Access Control
 
 Learning Outcomes
 Understand the trade-offs of access control for testing purposes
 Expand behavior checking (and coverage) using test spy objects
 
 Test visibility: public vs @testable (internal)
 We start by moving the RemoteFeedLoader class and the HTTPClient protocol to a new production file to facilitate our development workflow. By doing so, our test target doesnâ€™t have access to our internal types anymore; thus we need to decide whether we will make our types public or leave them as internal and add the @testable attribute when importing our production module in the tests. We decided the former as we can test the Feed API module through the public interfaces it contains so that we can test the expected behavior as a client of the module. Another benefit of this approach is that we can now make changes to any internal or private implementation details without breaking our tests.
