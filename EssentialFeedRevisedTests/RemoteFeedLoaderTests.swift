/*
 Lecture 1.
 From Singletons and Globals to Proper Dependency Injection
 
 Learning Outcomes
 How to test-drive an API layer implementation
 Modular Design
 Singletons: When and Why
 Singletons: Better alternatives
 Singletons: Refactoring steps to gradually remove tight coupling created by singletons
 Controlling your dependencies: Locating globally shared instances (Implicit) vs. Injecting dependencies (Explicit)
 Controlling your dependencies: Dependency injection

/*
 Lecture 2.
 Asserting a Captured Value Is Not Enough + Cross-Module Access Control
 
 Learning Outcomes
 Understand the trade-offs of access control for testing purposes
 Expand behavior checking (and coverage) using test spy objects
 
 Test visibility: public vs @testable (internal)
 We start by moving the RemoteFeedLoader class and the HTTPClient protocol to a new production file to facilitate our development workflow. By doing so, our test target doesnâ€™t have access to our internal types anymore; thus we need to decide whether we will make our types public or leave them as internal and add the @testable attribute when importing our production module in the tests. We decided the former as we can test the Feed API module through the public interfaces it contains so that we can test the expected behavior as a client of the module. Another benefit of this approach is that we can now make changes to any internal or private implementation details without breaking our tests.

/*
 Lecture 3.
 Handling Errors + Stubbing vs. Spying + Eliminating Invalid Paths
 
 Stubs can be easily replaced with Capture that is a better one.
 Learning Outcomes
 Handling network errors
 Differences between stubbing and spying when unit testing
 How to extend code coverage by using samples of values to test specific test cases
 Design better code with enums to make invalid paths unrepresentable
