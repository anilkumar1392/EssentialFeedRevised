/*
 What does feed presenter do it receives events
 and translate those events in to presentable viewData or viewModels.
 So it's a translation layer it sends message to the view.
 
 View is the collaborator but now we need the action the initializer.

 */

// So if we create a feed Presenter with that view the view should not receive any messages.
/*
 We recommend you to start from the degenerate simple and trival behaviour first.
