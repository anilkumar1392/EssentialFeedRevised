## Refactoring Massive View Controllers Into Multiple Tiny MVCs + Using Composers & Adapters to Reduce Coupling and Eliminate Redundant Dependencies


// Clean code is a must but not enough we must also manage dependencies effectively.

Formating number and date, pagination, sharing images performing view animations and layouts firing analytice event and etc.



// Now to solve massive view controller problem we will create multiple conrtoller with one responsibility.
